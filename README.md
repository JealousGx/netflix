![Netflix UI Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JealousGx/netflix/netflix-ui/netflix.png)

This code contains only the necessary files for Netflix UI. Netflix is a great platform to watch latest / old movies, series and all. This project is basically a tutorial by [Lama Dev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzWG8jiw4XM). 

##Running the UI on your machine:
To run this code on your machine, you need to have:
- NodeJS or yarn
- Basic knowledge of NPM and React
Then simply do ```npm i && npm start``` and in case you have yarn, you have to type ```yarn``` and then ```yarn start```
