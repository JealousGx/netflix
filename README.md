This branch contains both, front-end as well as backend server. This project was a great MERN Stack tutorial by [Lama Dev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsNswx0nRKM). 
The tutorial was beginner friendly. For me, this is the first every Mern project I have ever created. 

The live demo will be shared here soon as I finish this project.
