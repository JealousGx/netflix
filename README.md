This branch contains both, front-end as well as backend server. This project was a great MERN Stack tutorial by [Lama Dev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsNswx0nRKM). 
The tutorial was beginner friendly. For me, this is the first every Mern project I have ever created. 

## Description
Basically, this is a Fullstack Mern based project. This project is literally a real world project where everything is done by the server and the user only enjoys the content of his choice.
So, in this case, the server stores the data like movies, users credentials, registration and movies lists. 

### Technology
The technology used in this project was:

```Frontend```
- React
- Material UI
- Sass as well as CSS

```Backend```
- NodeJS
- Express
- MondoDB (Database)
- Mongoose (Connecting database with the server)
- Firebase (Saving the movies and other stuff)
- JWT (JSON Web token to encrypt the passwords)


######Demo
To run this code on your machine, you need to have:

NodeJS or yarn
Basic knowledge of NPM and React Then simply do ```npm i && npm start``` in the client folder, and in case you have yarn, you have to type ```yarn``` and then ```yarn start```
---
Then you can just register and you will be redirected to the actual page where content lies.
